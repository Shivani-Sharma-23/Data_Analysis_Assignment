## ‚ú® Core Features

* **Interactive Date Filter**: The key feature is the sidebar filter that allows you to select a custom date range. The entire visualization dynamically updates to display the data for the selected period.
* **Data Visualization**: The main graph plots several key metrics:
    * The daily Performance Ratio (PR).
    * A 30-day moving average to show trends.
    * A target budget PR for performance comparison.
* **Contextual Insights**: Data points are color-coded based on daily solar irradiance (GHI), providing a quick visual reference for how weather conditions impact performance.
